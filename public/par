The Heart Track Application is a low-cost IoT-enabled web application designed to monitor and visualize heart rate and blood oxygen (SpO2) data in real-time. The system integrates a heart rate sensor connected to a microcontroller (Particle Photon), which sends data to a cloud-hosted backend. This data is stored in a MongoDB database and visualized on a web-based user interface, allowing users to monitor their health effectively.
